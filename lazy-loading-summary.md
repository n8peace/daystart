# DayStart App Launch Performance Optimization

## Summary of Changes

### 1. **Deferred Initialization in DayStartApp.swift**
- Removed heavy initialization from `init()` method
- Removed audio session configuration at startup
- Removed notification permission requests at startup
- Deferred background task registration

### 2. **Lazy HomeViewModel Initialization**
- Added `lazyInit` parameter to HomeViewModel
- AudioPlayerManager, NotificationScheduler, and other services are now optional
- Services initialize on-demand when first needed
- Added `ensureServicesInitialized()` method for just-in-time initialization

### 3. **Welcome Countdown Initialization**
- All heavy initialization moved to 5-minute countdown period
- Added `performDeferredInitialization()` in WelcomeDayStartScheduler
- Initialization happens in background during countdown:
  - AudioPlayerManager initialization
  - Audio session configuration
  - Permission requests (notifications, location)
  - Background task registration
  - Pre-creation of today's audio

### 4. **Progress Indicators**
- Added initialization progress tracking to WelcomeDayStartScheduler
- Shows progress steps during countdown (1-6 steps)
- Visual progress bar in HomeView during welcome countdown
- User sees "Preparing audio system...", "Setting up notifications...", etc.

### 5. **Simplified Onboarding**
- Removed immediate permission requests
- Removed immediate notification scheduling
- Everything deferred to countdown phase

## Expected Performance Impact

**Before:** 26 seconds to launch
**After:** <1 second to launch (estimated 26x improvement)

### Breakdown:
- **Instant (0-100ms):** App UI appears
- **During 5-min countdown:** All initialization happens invisibly
- **User perception:** App feels lightweight and responsive

## Testing Instructions

1. **Clean Install Test:**
   - Delete app from device
   - Build and run fresh install
   - Measure time from tap to onboarding screen
   - Complete onboarding and verify countdown shows progress

2. **Existing User Test:**
   - Run on device with existing data
   - Verify app still launches quickly
   - Verify audio playback works correctly

3. **Permission Test:**
   - During countdown, verify permissions are requested
   - Check notification and location permissions work

4. **Audio Initialization Test:**
   - After countdown, press play
   - Verify audio plays without delay
   - Check that all features work normally

## Risk Mitigation

- Services initialize on-demand if accessed before countdown
- Fallback initialization in play/replay methods
- No functionality lost, just deferred
- Progress indicators keep users informed
