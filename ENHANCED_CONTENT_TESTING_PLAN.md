# Enhanced Content System - Testing Plan

## Summary
The enhanced content system has been successfully implemented with full backward compatibility. Here's what we've built:

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Article Fetching (60-80 articles)
- **NewsAPI General**: 25 articles from top-headlines
- **NewsAPI Business**: 25 articles from business category  
- **NewsAPI Targeted**: 30 articles from high-impact keyword searches
- **GNews Comprehensive**: 25 articles from top-headlines
- **Total**: ~105 articles per refresh cycle (up from 10)

### 2. Intelligence Layer
- **Importance Scoring**: 0-100 scale based on topic keywords, source authority, recency
- **Topic Categorization**: politics, business, technology, health, climate, international, general
- **Geographic Scope**: local, state, national, international
- **Deduplication**: Removes duplicate stories across sources

### 3. AI Curation Pipeline
- **Diversity Filtering**: Ensures variety across topic categories
- **GPT-4o-mini Selection**: AI chooses final top 10 from top 25 candidates
- **Enhanced Descriptions**: Comprehensive 3-4 sentence summaries covering 5W+H (Who, What, Where, When, Why, How)
- **Enhanced Metadata**: AI summaries, selection reasons, rankings

### 4. Backward Compatibility
- **Existing APIs**: All current functions continue to work unchanged
- **Data Structure**: Maintains exact same format for `articles` array
- **Fallback Logic**: Graceful degradation if enhanced functions unavailable

## Data Flow

```
Raw Sources (105 articles)
    â†“
Intelligence Enhancement (scoring, categorization)
    â†“  
Deduplication & Diversity Filtering (â†’ 25 articles)
    â†“
GPT-4o-mini Final Selection (â†’ 10 top stories)
    â†“
Cache as 'top_ten_ai_curated' source
    â†“
process_jobs uses enhanced content automatically
```

## Testing Steps

### 1. Test Enhanced Content Generation
```bash
# Trigger content refresh to generate AI-curated content
curl -X POST https://your-supabase-url/functions/v1/refresh_content \
  -H "x-worker-token: YOUR_WORKER_TOKEN"
```

### 2. Verify Content Cache
```sql
-- Check if AI-curated content was generated
SELECT 
  source, 
  (data->>'articles_processed') as processed_count,
  (data->'generation_metadata'->>'ai_model') as ai_model,
  array_length(data->'stories', 1) as story_count,
  created_at
FROM content_cache 
WHERE source = 'top_ten_ai_curated' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```

### 3. Test Process Jobs Integration  
```bash
# Create a test job and verify it uses enhanced content
# The job should automatically get top 10 AI-curated stories
```

### 4. Verify Content Quality
```sql
-- Check story importance scores and categories
SELECT 
  (story->>'title') as title,
  (story->>'importance_score') as score,
  (story->>'topic_category') as category,
  (story->>'ai_rank') as rank
FROM content_cache cc,
     jsonb_array_elements(cc.data->'stories') as story
WHERE cc.source = 'top_ten_ai_curated'
ORDER BY (story->>'ai_rank')::int;
```

## Expected Results

### Content Volume
- **Before**: 10 total articles (5 NewsAPI + 5 GNews)
- **After**: 105 total articles â†’ 10 AI-curated top stories

### Content Quality Improvements
- **Importance Scoring**: Stories ranked by actual impact vs random selection
- **Topic Diversity**: Balanced coverage across politics, business, international, etc.
- **AI Summaries**: Enhanced descriptions optimized for TTS
- **Deduplication**: No more duplicate stories from multiple sources

### Performance Impact
- **API Calls**: ~4x more external API calls (but within rate limits)
- **Processing Time**: +30-60 seconds for AI analysis
- **Cost**: ~$0.01-0.03 per refresh cycle for GPT-4o-mini processing
- **Script Generation**: Same speed (now gets better input)

## Rollback Plan
If issues arise, the system gracefully falls back to original behavior:
1. Enhanced functions fail â†’ uses original `get_fresh_content`
2. AI processing fails â†’ uses basic importance ranking
3. Top 10 generation fails â†’ doesn't break existing content

## Migration Notes
1. Apply migration `025_add_ai_curated_content_support.sql`
2. Deploy enhanced `refresh_content` function
3. Deploy updated `process_jobs` function
4. Test content generation
5. Monitor logs for AI processing success

## Success Metrics
- âœ… AI-curated content appears in content_cache
- âœ… process_jobs successfully uses enhanced content
- âœ… Generated scripts include high-quality, diverse stories
- âœ… No degradation in script generation speed
- âœ… Fallback works if enhanced functions unavailable

## Monitoring
Watch for these log messages:
- `ðŸ§  Starting enhanced news intelligence processing...`
- `âœ… Enhanced news processing completed`
- `ðŸ¤– Using GPT-4o-mini to select final top 10 stories...`
- `âœ… Successfully cached top 10 AI-curated stories`
