## [2025.11.1] - In Development

**Build:** 1 | **Commit:** b371e19 | **Status:** üöß In Development

### Added
- **Content Freshness Tracking** - Maximum content freshness with intelligent fallback system
  - New `content_fetch_log` table tracks all API fetch attempts and failures
  - Healthcheck now shows which sources are using stale cache due to API failures
  - Content fetched every 30 minutes (was only when 7-day cache expired!)
  - Automatic fallback to cached content when APIs fail
  - Tracks cache age when fallback is used (e.g., "Using 18h old cache")
  - New healthcheck section shows fresh/stale/critical sources at a glance
  - SQL function `get_content_freshness_summary()` for monitoring content age
  - RLS policies secure content_fetch_log table (service_role only)
  - Automatic cleanup of logs older than 7 days to prevent unbounded growth

### Changed
- **Content Refresh Strategy** - Always fetch fresh, use cache as backup
  - Previously: Only fetched new content after 7-day expiration
  - Now: Attempts fresh fetch every 30 minutes, falls back to cache on failure
  - Result: News/sports/stocks always < 30 minutes old when APIs work
  - Maintains 7-day cache for reliability during API outages
  - Logs all fetch attempts for visibility into content freshness

### Fixed
- **Week-old Content Issue** - Users no longer see stale news and outdated sports scores
  - Root cause: Content was only refreshed after 168-hour TTL expiration
  - Now content is always fresh with automatic fallback to cache
  - Added comprehensive logging to track when cache fallback occurs
