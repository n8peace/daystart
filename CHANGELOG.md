## Development & Infrastructure 🔧

### September 9, 2025
🏈 **Multi-Sport ESPN API Enhancement**

**New Feature:**
- Expanded ESPN API integration to fetch all major sports instead of just NBA
- Now retrieves NFL, College Football, MLB, NBA, and NHL games in a single content cache
- Added comprehensive sports data parsing for consistent processing across all sources

**Sports Coverage Added:**
- **NFL**: 8 games per fetch (prime time for September football season)
- **College Football (NCAAF)**: 6 games per fetch (peak season coverage)  
- **MLB**: 8 games per fetch (including playoff push and postseason)
- **NHL**: 6 games per fetch (preseason and regular season)
- **NBA**: 6 games per fetch (maintained existing coverage)

**Technical Implementation:**
- Enhanced `fetchESPN()` function with parallel API calls to multiple ESPN endpoints
- Added `flattenAndParseSports()` function to handle multi-sport data parsing
- Robust error handling - if individual sports fail, others continue successfully
- Comprehensive logging showing successful/failed sports fetches and game counts
- Single content cache entry combines all sports for efficient storage

**Impact:**
- Users now get relevant sports updates for current season (NFL/College Football in September vs NBA preseason)
- Much richer sports content in morning briefings across all major sports
- Better seasonal awareness - shows active sports rather than off-season games
- Improved sports filtering and processing with consistent data structure

**Files Modified:**
- `supabase/functions/refresh_content/index.ts` - Multi-sport ESPN API integration
- `supabase/functions/process_jobs/index.ts` - Sports data parsing and processing logic

🔧 **Stock Data Processing Fix**

**Bug Fix:**
- Fixed critical stock data parsing issue causing 0 stocks to appear in morning briefings
- Stock data was stored as JSON-stringified content but code expected pre-parsed arrays
- Added `flattenAndParseStocks()` function to properly extract quotes from multiple data formats

**Technical Details:**

- Improved error handling for malformed stock data sources
- Added debug logging to track stock parsing success

**Impact:**
- Users with stock preferences will now see their selected stocks in morning briefings

## iOS App Releases 📱

### v2025.09.4 (Build 7) - September 8-9, 2025
🍌 **The "Permission Flow Fix & Native iOS Experience" Release**
📱 **App Store Compliance Fix** - Resolving Guideline 5.1.1 and 4.0 rejection

🎯 **iPad Support Removed (September 9):**
- Changed to iPhone-only app to address iPad layout issues
- App Store rejection showed onboarding buttons cut off on iPad Pro 11"
- Since DayStart is optimized for portrait-only morning routines, iPhone-only is the appropriate configuration

✨ **Permission Request Redesign:**
- **Removed skip buttons** from weather and calendar permission screens per Apple guidelines
- **Redesigned permission flow** with clearer messaging:
  - Simplified titles to "Weather Permission" / "Calendar Permission"
  - Updated descriptions to explain what will be asked
  - Added emphasis that permissions are "completely optional"
  - Streamlined content order: description → benefits → optional message
- **Enhanced user experience**:
  - Concise "Enable Weather" / "Enable Calendar" buttons
  - Auto-advance to next page regardless of permission choice (allow/deny)
  - Smart swipe behavior: backward swipes work normally, forward swipes trigger permission request
  - Visual feedback: buttons show green (enabled), red (disabled), or default state
  - Removed error states - permission denial is treated as valid user choice
- **Maintains functionality**: Weather/calendar features automatically enabled/disabled based on permission choice

📱 **Onboarding Consistency & Native iOS Feel (September 9):**
- **Standardized button positioning** across all 10 onboarding pages
  - Consistent bottom spacing: `max(44, geometry.safeAreaInsets.bottom + 24)`
  - All buttons now at the same visual distance from bottom on all devices
- **Native iOS fixed layouts** for better user experience:
  - Converted pages 5-8 from ScrollView to fixed VStack layout
  - No unexpected scrolling - content optimized to fit on screen
  - Maintains scrollable paywall for conversion optimization
- **Enhanced spacing and margins**:
  - Increased horizontal padding from 8% to 10% for better readability
  - Fixed cramped paywall spacing (top spacer 2%→8%, sections 1-2%→4%)
  - Consistent content spacing patterns across all pages
- **Skip button improvements**:
  - Added "Use default voice" skip option to voice selection page
  - Only 2 skip buttons total: Name (page 2) and Voice (page 7) for optional personalization

🎨 **Native iOS Design Patterns:**
- **Fixed VStack layouts** (Pages 0-8) for iPhone-native onboarding feel
- **Optimized ScrollView** (Page 9 - Paywall) for complex conversion-critical content
- **Responsive design** maintains compatibility across iPhone and iPad sizes
- **Consistent interaction model** - no mixing of scrollable and fixed content

🎨 **UI Readability Improvements (September 9):**
- **Enhanced text readability** across the app:
  - Changed small yellow/primary colored text to gray (secondaryText) for better contrast
  - Updated onboarding preview text, schedule summaries, and anticipation text
  - Modified Edit Schedule view informational text for improved visibility
- **Settings UI refinements**:
  - Theme picker accent color changed from yellow to gray
  - Quote Style picker accent color updated to gray
  - "Add Symbol" button text changed to gray
  - "Restore Purchase"/"Upgrade to Premium" button text now uses gray
  - All informational messages ("Select at least one day", "DayStart Disabled", etc.) now in gray
- **Maintains yellow accent** for interactive elements like toggle switches and primary action buttons

🔧 **Technical Implementation:**
- Updated `requestLocationPermission()` and `requestCalendarPermission()` handlers with auto-advance
- Implemented custom gesture handling for permission pages using `simultaneousGesture`
- Removed conditional UI states and error displays
- Improved onboarding flow continuity
- Converted ScrollView + fixed bottom patterns to unified VStack layouts
- Proper geometry.safeAreaInsets.bottom handling across all devices
- Updated version to 2025.09.4 (Build 7) in Info.plist

🐛 **Schedule Update Fix (September 9):**
- **Fixed backend job scheduling updates**: Schedule time changes now properly update existing jobs' scheduled_at timestamps
- **Root cause**: Backend `update_jobs` function only updated job settings, not scheduled times
- **Solution**: Added `scheduled_time` parameter to update_jobs API and client implementation
- **Impact**: Schedule changes (e.g., 14:05 → 14:08) now reflect immediately without requiring app restart
- **Technical details**:
  - Extended `UpdateJobsRequest` interface with optional `scheduled_time` field
  - Modified `buildUpdatePayload()` to handle scheduled_at database updates  
  - Updated client `updateJobs()` method and schedule change handler to pass new times
  - Fixed precision issues in time comparison logic using 1-second threshold

🐛 **UI Update Fix (September 9):**
- **Fixed immediate UI feedback**: Schedule time changes now update "Next DayStart" display instantly
- **Root cause**: Schedule observer wasn't using MainActor threading pattern for UI updates
- **Solution**: Fixed HomeViewModel schedule observer to ensure immediate SwiftUI refresh
- **Impact**: Next alarm time now updates instantly in UI when schedule is changed
- **Technical details**:
  - Added `Task { @MainActor in ... }` wrapper to schedule observer
  - Added explicit `objectWillChange.send()` to force SwiftUI refresh
  - Fixed `DateFormatter.shortTime` access issue using centralized FormatterCache
  - Added debug logging to track schedule change propagation

🎯 **Onboarding Improvements (September 9):**

- **Added location benefits**: Added "Localized news & sports" to location permission benefits list
- **Fixed default quote type**: Changed from "Stoic" to "Good Feelings" for new users
- **Consistent behavior**: Location permission now works as reliably as calendar permission
- **Root cause**: Complex early-exit logic allowed bypassing permission dialog when status was already determined
- **Solution**: Simplified permission flow to match calendar permission pattern exactly
- **Technical details**:
  - Removed early returns in `requestLocationPermission()` that skipped user interaction
  - Reduced function from 43 lines to 19 lines with consistent flow
  - Always calls permission request regardless of current status
  - Let iOS system handle already-granted cases gracefully
  - Fixed conflicting defaults: `UserSettings.default` had `.goodFeelings` but `OnboardingView` started with `.stoic`
