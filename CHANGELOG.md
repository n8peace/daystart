🍌 **The "Permission Flow Fix & Native iOS Experience" Release**
📱 **App Store Compliance Fix** - Resolving Guideline 5.1.1 and 4.0 rejection

🎯 **iPad Support Removed (September 9):**
- Changed to iPhone-only app to address iPad layout issues
- App Store rejection showed onboarding buttons cut off on iPad Pro 11"
- Since DayStart is optimized for portrait-only morning routines, iPhone-only is the appropriate configuration

✨ **Permission Request Redesign:**
- **Removed skip buttons** from weather and calendar permission screens per Apple guidelines
- **Redesigned permission flow** with clearer messaging:
  - Simplified titles to "Weather Permission" / "Calendar Permission"
  - Updated descriptions to explain what will be asked
  - Added emphasis that permissions are "completely optional"
  - Streamlined content order: description → benefits → optional message
- **Enhanced user experience**:
  - Concise "Enable Weather" / "Enable Calendar" buttons
  - Auto-advance to next page regardless of permission choice (allow/deny)
  - Smart swipe behavior: backward swipes work normally, forward swipes trigger permission request
  - Visual feedback: buttons show green (enabled), red (disabled), or default state
  - Removed error states - permission denial is treated as valid user choice
- **Maintains functionality**: Weather/calendar features automatically enabled/disabled based on permission choice

📱 **Onboarding Consistency & Native iOS Feel (September 9):**
- **Standardized button positioning** across all 10 onboarding pages
  - Consistent bottom spacing: `max(44, geometry.safeAreaInsets.bottom + 24)`
  - All buttons now at the same visual distance from bottom on all devices
- **Native iOS fixed layouts** for better user experience:
  - Converted pages 5-8 from ScrollView to fixed VStack layout

- **Optimized ScrollView** (Page 9 - Paywall) for complex conversion-critical content
- **Responsive design** maintains compatibility across iPhone and iPad sizes
- **Consistent interaction model** - no mixing of scrollable and fixed content

- **Technical details**:
  - Removed early returns in `requestLocationPermission()` that skipped user interaction
  - Reduced function from 43 lines to 19 lines with consistent flow
  - Always calls permission request regardless of current status
  - Let iOS system handle already-granted cases gracefully
  - Fixed conflicting defaults: `UserSettings.default` had `.goodFeelings` but `OnboardingView` started with `.stoic`
