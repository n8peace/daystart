üéØ **iPad Support Removed (September 9):**
- Changed to iPhone-only app to address iPad layout issues
- App Store rejection showed onboarding buttons cut off on iPad Pro 11"
- Since DayStart is optimized for portrait-only morning routines, iPhone-only is the appropriate configuration

  - Simplified titles to "Weather Permission" / "Calendar Permission"

  - Smart swipe behavior: backward swipes work normally, forward swipes trigger permission request
  - Visual feedback: buttons show green (enabled), red (disabled), or default state

üì± **Onboarding Consistency & Native iOS Feel (September 9):**
