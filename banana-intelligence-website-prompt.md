# Banana Intelligence Website Creation Prompt

## Project Overview
Create a modern, playful, and professional website for Banana Intelligence - an AI app development company that creates intelligent iOS applications.

"Let's address the elephant‚Äîer, fruit‚Äîin the room. Yes, we build exclusively for Apple devices. Yes, our company is called Banana Intelligence. No, we don't see the irony (we see the opportunity).

**Why We Chose Bananas:**
- üçå **More Potassium**: Our apps are packed with more features than you can shake a fruit at

The truth is, bananas are brain food. They're packed with nutrients that boost cognitive function‚Äîjust like our AI-powered apps boost your iPhone's capabilities. We're not trying to keep doctors away; we're trying to bring intelligence to your daily routine."

#### Our Philosophy Section
**Headline**: "Ripe Thinking for Smart Solutions"
