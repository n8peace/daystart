# DayStart App Store Readiness Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the remaining compliance and technical items needed before DayStart can be released to the App Store. The app now uses a **purchase-based identity system** where users are identified by their StoreKit receipt IDs (paid = access).

**Timeline Recommendation:** Ready for App Store submission immediately after build upload.

**Risk Level:** ðŸŸ¢ **LOW** - All critical blockers resolved, only build upload and testing remain.
