# DayStart App Store Readiness Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the remaining compliance and technical items needed before DayStart can be released to the App Store. The app now uses a **purchase-based identity system** where users are identified by their StoreKit receipt IDs (paid = access).

**Timeline Recommendation:** Ready for App Store submission in ~1-2 weeks.

**Risk Level:** ðŸŸ¢ **LOW** - Core functionality complete, critical backend auth issues resolved; remaining items are App Store compliance and testing.
