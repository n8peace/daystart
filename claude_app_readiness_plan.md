# DayStart App Store Readiness Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the remaining compliance and technical items needed before DayStart can be released to the App Store. The app now uses a **purchase-based identity system** where users are identified by their StoreKit receipt IDs (paid = access).

**Timeline Recommendation:** Ready for App Store submission in ~1-2 weeks.

**Risk Level:** ðŸŸ¡ **MEDIUM** - Core functionality complete but several App Store review blockers need immediate attention.

## ðŸ”´ Critical Review Blockers (Fix Before Submission)

### 1. Privacy/Terms Documents
**Issue:** PRIVACY_POLICY.md and TERMS_OF_SERVICE.md have placeholders
**Fix:** Replace all bracketed placeholders with real info and host at:
- https://daystart.bananaintelligence.ai/privacy
- https://daystart.bananaintelligence.ai/terms

### 2. Paywall Button Functionality
**Issue:** "Restore," "Terms," "Privacy" buttons do nothing (OnboardingView.swift L1515-1527)
**Fix:** Wire up:
- Restore â†’ Call `purchaseManager.restorePurchases()`
- Terms â†’ Open terms URL in Safari
- Privacy â†’ Open privacy URL in Safari

### 3. Info.plist Background Modes
**Issue:** Over-declared modes including invalid "background-processing"
**Fix:** Keep only:
- audio
- processing
Remove: background-processing, fetch, remote-notification

### 4. Remove simulatePurchase Function
**Issue:** Test function in PurchaseManager.swift will cause rejection
**Fix:** Delete entire `simulatePurchase` function
